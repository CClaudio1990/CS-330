# How do I approach designing software?
This project helped me hone my ability to develop modular and easily reusable code. A lot of the
work I did involved repurposing code that rendered one 3D shape and changing it to render a different shape.
All I had to do was change the DrawMesh method call and change the position and scale values.
Additionally, the project was broken up into 6 Milestones that each achieved a new key component of
the finished project. Doing this allowed me to manage the workload and gain a good understanding
of what needed to be done. I will adopt this tactic for future work because each milestone is managable.
# How do I approach developing programs?
I tend to approach designing software in phases. The early phases involve creating a basic, usable example of the final
product. In the later phases, the fine details are added and issues that arise are corrected along with adding any features
or functions that may be wanted as the software is tested. The milestones acted as phases of this project. Each one
added a new element to it.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science helps me advance my career in the tech industry. I already have some experience but adding a CS degree has greatly
expanded my skills and knowledge. Specifically here, computational graphics is central to designing visually pleasing UI's and given
the use of OpenGL and C++, I was able to learn how to understand the code. Seeing how 3D objects are coded gave me a better understanding
of how the interface side of software works.
